# Build Your Own Adversary Simulator: Protect, Detect, Measure


# The Idea
I talk to many organizations every day about cyber security. Eventually, we get on the topic of PenTesting. Most of the times we hear about how expensive they are, and how they won't be paying for one this year due to other projects and PenTesting is expensive.

PenTesting to our industry is two things:

1. Meeting compliance (very common)

2. Validating controls (less common)

This idea came up as I want to help organizations see value in their products before drowning in more tech debt. Most organizations I speak with, haven't even began centrally logging, orchestrating or performing any automation. We're seeing many still getting hung up on marketing fluff, AI, ML and unicorns.

The other side of the spectrum is we have a lot of tools willing to perform adversary simulations, but nothing free and open source. We have a lot of free and open source, but nothing properly categorized or made into adversary simulations. Then, we have the gap today where nobody is providing their adversary sim measurements to help other organizations.

This project is:

1. Provide the basic foundation for building an adversary simulation program
2. Provide foundational measurements to track and understand where your organization stands in comparison to adversaries


Look at this project as a way to save money, enhance your current security stack and provide proper and actionable measurements.
