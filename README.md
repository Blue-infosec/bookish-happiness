# The Idea
I talk to many organizations every day about cyber security. Eventually, we get on the topic of PenTesting. Most of the times we hear about how expensive they are, and how they won't be paying for one this year due to other projects and PenTesting is expensive.

PenTesting to our industry is two things:

1. Meeting compliance (very common)

2. Validating controls (less common)

This idea came up as I want to help organizations see value in their products before drowning in more tech debt. Most organizations I speak with, haven't even began centrally logging, orchestrating or performing any automation. We're seeing many still getting hung up on marketing fluff, AI, ML and unicorns.

# Phase 1

Specifically testing your current security products whether automated or manual. This will be a mix of currently available tools and anything I make custom. This will not be pretty, however it will get you to Z in no time.

**Network**

***PCAP replay***

I'm finding that PCAP replay may be the most effective way to properly test security appliances that promise to detect or prevent all the things.


***Firewall***

[EgressBuster - TrustedSec](https://github.com/trustedsec/egressbuster)

# Phase 2

***Adversary Testing***



Look at this project as a way to save money, enhance your current security stack and test all the things.
